# My Project Template

This project template  was originally generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.0.
I configured the bootstrap CSS style for it.
I added a sample page with an input field and two-way binding text output for the field's value.

## Installation

To install angular, follow this script.

### Updating NodeJS:

Go to nodejs.org and download the latest version - uninstall (all) installed versions on your machine first.

### Updating npm

Run ```[sudo] npm install -g npm  (sudo  is only required on Mac/ Linux)```

### Updating the CLI

Run ```[sudo] npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli ```

Run ```npm cache clean```

Run ```[sudo] npm install -g @angular/cli```


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
